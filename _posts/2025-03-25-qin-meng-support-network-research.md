## Support Network Typology and Psychological Well-Being Among Young Adults

The Communication and Computation Lab is pleased to announce that lab member Jiaqi Qin, working under the mentorship of Professor Jingbo Meng, has published a research article in Health Communication. The article, titled "Support Network Typology and Psychological Well-Being Among Young Adults," was published online on March 25, 2025.

This study investigates how different types of support networks influence psychological well-being among young adults. The research identifies distinct patterns of social support structures and examines their relationship with various mental health outcomes. By understanding these patterns, the researchers aim to develop more effective support interventions for young adults experiencing psychological distress.

The findings highlight the importance of considering network structure, not just the presence of support, when assessing psychological well-being. This research builds on Professor Meng's ongoing work on social networks and support communication, further establishing the lab's expertise in this important area of health communication research.
