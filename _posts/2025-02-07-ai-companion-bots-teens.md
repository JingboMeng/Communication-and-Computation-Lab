## AI Companion Bots: Benefits and Risks for Teenagers

In recent research examining AI companions and their effects on psychological health, Professor Jingbo Meng from Ohio State University's School of Communication has found important distinctions between machine and human interaction patterns.

"Competent communication from a chatbot doesn't translate to psychological well-being," notes Professor Meng, whose research focuses on social networks, chatbots, and artificial intelligence systems.

Her studies indicate that users might not consciously recognize differences when interacting with AI versus humans, yet when people are aware they're communicating with an actual caring person, there's a measurable reduction in psychological distress. This finding has significant implications as AI companion apps like Replika, Character.AI, and Snapchat's My AI gain popularity among teenagers.

Professor Meng emphasizes the importance of balancing technology with human connection: "There's a need to better integrate human and AI interactionsâ€”so that AI doesn't replace human contact." She also advocates for improved digital literacy education in schools to help young people navigate these emerging technologies.

The research contributes to a growing body of knowledge about AI companions, which experts note can provide emotional support but also pose risks including dependency, privacy concerns, and potentially harmful advice.
